  title: Old World API
  description: |
    REST API for the Old World game mod that exposes game state and accepts commands for companion apps, overlays, and external tools.

    ## Overview

    This API provides:
    - **Read access** to game state including players, cities, characters, units, tribes, diplomacy, and events
    - **Command execution** for unit actions, city production, research, and turn management

    All data uses game type strings (e.g., `NATION_ROME`, `YIELD_FOOD`, `UNIT_WARRIOR`) for unambiguous identification.

    **Note:** Commands are disabled in multiplayer games.

    ## Connection

    The HTTP REST server runs on port 9877 when the mod is active and a game is loaded.

    ## CORS

    All endpoints include CORS headers for browser access:
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS`
